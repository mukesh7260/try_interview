2. Install PostgreSQL:
   - Use the following command to install PostgreSQL and its dependencies:
     ```
     sudo apt install postgresql
     ```

3. Verify PostgreSQL Installation:
   - After the installation is complete, PostgreSQL service will start automatically.
   - You can check the status of the service using the following command:
     ```
     sudo systemctl status postgresql
     ```

4. Access PostgreSQL:
   - By default, PostgreSQL creates a system user called "postgres" during installation.
   - Switch to the "postgres" user using the following command:
     ```
     sudo su - postgres
     ```

5. Access PostgreSQL Shell:
   - Once you are logged in as the "postgres" user, you can access the PostgreSQL shell by running the following command:
     ```
     psql
     ```

6. Create a New User and Database (Optional):
   - If you want to create a new user and database, you can use the following commands in the PostgreSQL shell:
     - Create a new user:
       ```
       CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
       ```
     - Create a new database:
       ```
       CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
       ```
     - Grant privileges to the user on the database:
       ```
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_username;
       ```

7. Exit PostgreSQL Shell and Switch Back to Regular User:
   - To exit the PostgreSQL shell, type `\q` and press Enter.
   - Switch back to your regular user account using the following command:
     ```
     exit
     ```

8. Start Using PostgreSQL:
   - Now you can start using PostgreSQL on your Ubuntu system.
   - You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using a variety of tools such as pgAdmin or by using PostgreSQL-specific libraries in your programming language of choice.

NOt NUll.
CHECK
DEFAULT
UNIQUE
PRIMARY kEY
FOREIGN KEY 

create table student(

## There are three data type in mysql. 

1. Numeric 
2. String 
3. Date & Time

create table student ( name varchar(55), age int); 
show tables;

		####### Use of alter command in mysql . 

the ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database table. You can use the ALTER command to perform various operations on a table, such as adding or dropping columns, changing column data types, modifying column constraints, and renaming the table itself. Here are some common use cases for the ALTER command:


1. Add a Column: You can use ALTER TABLE to add a new column to an existing table. For 
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD column_name datatype;
2. Modify a Column: You can use ALTER TABLE to modify the properties of an existing column, such as changing its data type or adding constraints. For example:
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	MODIFY column_name new_datatype;
3. Drop a Column: You can use ALTER TABLE to remove a column from an existing table. For example:
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	DROP COLUMN column_name;
4. Rename a Table: You can use ALTER TABLE to rename an existing table. For example:
	ALTER TABLE old_table_name
 	RENAME TO new_table_name;
5. Add or Remove Indexes: You can use ALTER TABLE to add or remove indexes on one or more columns in the table.

6. Change Table Engine: You can change the storage engine of a table using the ALTER TABLE command.

7. Add Constraints: You can use ALTER TABLE to add constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, or unique constraints to a table.

8. Change Table Collation: You can change the collation of a table using ALTER TABLE to specify how character data is sorted and compared.


			Primary Key: 

-> The primary key constraint uniquely identified each record in a table .
-> Primary keys must contain unique values and can not contain Null values.

create table stud_unique( stu_id int not null , name varchar(55), age int,  primary key (stu_id) );     

			Auto Increament : 

 create table university(id int auto_increment primary key, name varchar(11), city varchar(11));     #### This is also good . 

Auto increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. 

create table stud_auto( stu_id int not null AUTO_INCREMENT  , name varchar(55), age int,  primary key (stu_id) ); 

create table student (id int not null auto_increment, fname varchar(44), lname varchar(55) , age int , primary key(id));   

insert into student (fname, lname, age) values('llll', 'kkkk',23),('www','qqqq',34); 

			where clouse. 

-> It is used for filter data or record.
select * from student where age = 23;    

			update means  .

modify the record or data from table. 
update table_name set column_name where column_name or id = 1;

update student set age = 25 where fname = 'llll';     
   
delete from student where id = 1; 

			distinct means :- uniques value.

The select distinct statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. 
select distinct fname from student;    
 
			order by : - shorting from assecending or desecending or randomly. 

select age from student order by age; 
select distinct age from student order by age;    
select age from student order by age desc;    
      
			LIMIT IN SQL. 

select age from student order by age limit 3; 

			like operator in sql. 

The LIKE operators is used in a where clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. 

select fname from student where fname like '%w%';   

			Aggrigrate function in sql. 

Aggrigrate function : - It performs calculation on a set of value and return a single result. 

max, min, count , avg & sum. 

select max(age) from student;    
select min(age) from student; 
select sum(age) from student;   
select count(id) from student;        
select avg(age) from student;

			logical operator in sql. 
It returns only true or false. 

select * from student where age !=25;    
select * from student where age > 25;  
select * from student where age > 25 OR age < 29;    
select * from student where age between 22 and 25;  
select * from student where age <=25 && age>=25;  
select * from student where fname in('www');  

			MYSQL STRING FUNCTION. 

select concat('www',' ' , 'lname');  
select concat(fname,' ' , lname) from student as fullname;               
select reverse('mukesh');   
select concat('mukesh', reverse('mukesh')) as palindrom;                                  
select char_length('mukesh');      
select upper('mukesh');   

			date time in sql. 

create table datestu( name varchar(55), dob date, dot time, bt datetime);      
insert into datestu values('mukesh', '1996-01-15' , '6:15:24', '1996-01-15 6:15:24');          
insert into datestu values('mukesh', curdate(),curtime(),now()); 
      
								FOREIGN KEY . 

A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together . 
A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table refers to the primary key in another table.

create table customers(cid int not null auto_increment primary key, cname varchar(55), email varchar(44));  

create table orders(oid int not null auto_increment primary key,orderdate date , cid int, foreign key(cid) references customers(cid)); 



							SQL JOINING


select * from customers,orders where customers.cid=orders.cid;   ## adding two table. 

select * from customers inner join orders ON customers.cid = orders.cid;    -- inner  join.   

select * from customers left join orders ON customers.cid = orders.cid;     -- left join.            
    
select * from customers right join orders ON customers.cid = orders.cid;     -- right join.   

	here  customers = 1st table, orders = 2nd table. 

  
     							Group by: - 

The group by command is used to group the result set(used with aggregate function: count, max, min, sum , avg).

select count(id), fname , lname from students group by lname;


Group by defintion : - used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column.

syntax :- SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s);

					table created or not use this commad . 

SHOW TABLES LIKE 'table_name';


					INDEXING IN MYSQL. 

create index index_name on table_name(column1, column2, column3...);
show index from table_name;
drop index index_name on table_name;

					imp. notes 

-> sql command yadi commit ho gya then rollback nahi hota h. :- care it. 
:- rollback & commit command works for only three command  insert , update & delete. 


Q what is views in mysql 
ans: - we will make for views using more and more time using views name as place of written of many times code . 
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';


SELECT * FROM employee_view;
